              NotAHuman uses OpenAI's state-of-the-art GPT-3.5 language model to predict the end of your sentence or paragraph
              as you type.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you stop typing, NotAHuman will suggest the most likely completion of your sentence or paragraph.
              This suggestion is based on the context of your input, as well as the context of the entire page.
            </p>
            <p>
              The suggestion will appear as selected text in the input field, and you can accept the suggestion by
              pressing the enter key, or reject the suggestion by pressing the backspace key.

              NotAHuman works on any website that has input fields, including Gmail, Outlook, Twitter, Facebook, and
              more.
            </p>
            <p>
              NotAHuman does not support rich text editors, such the contents of a Google Doc, however does support
              custom input fields on modern websites, such as Twitter's tweet composer or Gmail's email composer.

            Can I customize the suggestions provided by <i>NotAHuman</i>?

        <div class="answerContainer">
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              Yes, you can customize the suggestions to respond to a specific piece of text by selecting the text and
              clicking the "Respond to this text with AI..." option from the right click menu.
            </p>
            <p>
              This will ensure that the suggestion is based on the context of the selected text, rather than the
              context of the entire page, which may be useful when you want to respond to a specific piece of text.

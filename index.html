              NotAHuman uses OpenAI's state-of-the-art GPT-3.5 language model to predict the end of your sentence or
              paragraph as you type.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you stop typing, NotAHuman will suggest the most likely completion of your sentence or paragraph.
              This suggestion is based on the context of your input, as well as the context of the entire page.
            </p>
            <p>
              The suggestion will appear as selected text in the input field, and you can accept the suggestion by
              pressing the right arrow key, or reject the suggestion by pressing the backspace key.
